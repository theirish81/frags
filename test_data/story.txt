The butterfly had wings like stained glass, fragile as a whispered secret. Dawn clung to her in trembling droplets as she drifted above the meadow, tasting the early light. She believed herself a creature made only for beauty, for fleeting touches of air, for that shimmering dance which leaves no trace.

The sparrow watched her from the crooked branch of a hawthorn. He was small, rough-feathered, with the pragmatic heart of one who has survived too many storms. Yet something in that trembling flutter—so light it seemed it could fall apart from its own longing—unsettled him.

He flew close. Not hunting, not chasing—simply curious.

“You move,” he said, “as though the world is soft.”

The butterfly hovered, her wings trembling. “Isn’t it?”

The sparrow gave a dry little laugh. “Only if you never land.”

For a moment they circled each other—air on air, two creatures whose lives should never intersect. Yet the wind carried them into a strange intimacy, the kind that forms between beings who recognize, however briefly, the same hunger. She desired the world without being crushed by it; he desired a world that didn’t grind him into dust.

When she finally dared to settle on the branch beside him, the sparrow felt his chest tighten, as though he were holding a shard of the sun.

“You’re delicate,” he murmured.

“And you’re afraid of it,” she replied.

He wanted to deny it, but her reflection trembled in his dark pupil—too bright, too breakable. In that shimmer he saw a truth he had never asked for: that courage isn’t the absence of fear but the willingness to perch beside something that could be ruined by a careless breath.

A breeze rose. The butterfly lifted again, carried by a force she could never resist.

“Will you come back?” the sparrow asked.

“Only if the wind allows,” she answered.

And then she was gone—just a flicker, a sigh, a memory of color dissolving into sky. But the sparrow kept the warmth where she had rested, a small defiant ember, glowing long after the branch grew cold.

Sometimes, he thought, the briefest encounter leaves the deepest imprint—precisely because it could never stay.
